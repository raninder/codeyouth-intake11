<h3>Variables</h3>

// Finish the following code;

let a = 4;
let  = 2;

console.log(a - b);

// Create two variables and assign them Number values, add them together.



// Match the values to the datatypes
// 10 "Hello" false

let string

let number

let boolean



// Finish the code so that both sentences are complete

// console.log("My favorite fruit is " + favoriteFruit);

// console.log("And my least favorite fruit is ");






//Check to see if the two variables are not equal;

let rating1 = 5;
let rating2 = 4;



//Write some code to check if the following variable is 5;

let rng = Math.floor(Math.random()*10);


// Find the total cost of all the items, then find the cost of tax. Finally display the Total, Tax, and Total + tax as a dollar value;
//Tax formula (total * tax) / 100


let skateboard = 5.99;

let fryingPan = 11.99;

let piano = 12.99;

let table = 199.99;

let notebook = 4.59;



<h3>Functions</h3>

// Write a function that console.logs hello world and call it.



// Write a function with the parameter, howdy, console.log the value of howdy



// Write a function that takes two arguments. Add them together;


// Write a function that will calculate the tax of a number passed through.


// Write and call a function that will return the string howdy





// Write a function for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Have all functions return the value.
// Bonus, try using default parameters to avoid returning NaN on any of the functions



// Write a function that will console.log a madlib. use prompt(); to get a noun, adverb, verb, and an adjective from the user.



// Write a function that will return a random number from 0 - 100;

<h3>For Loops</h3>

//1 Create a loop that console.logs from 1 to 10


//2 Create a loop that console.logs from 0 to 10


//3 Create a loop that console.logs from 10 to 1


//4 Create a loop that console.logs every even number from 0 to 50 


//5 Create a loop that will count from 0 to 100, using the loop try to find what the random number is. when you find it, stop the loop
let randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random()*101);




// Create a loop that will console.log every letter in the word "Howdy"



// Write some code that will count to 10, 10 times




// Write a loop that will run 50 times. Check each number to see if it is a multiple of 3



// Write a loop that will check each letter in a word and console.log if it is a vowel or not.


// Write a loop that will take any word and reverse it




//Using a loop, Ask a user for their 5 favorite things. console.log what there favorite things are
//Use prompt();



//Write some code that will continue prompting a user for a number until they enter a negative number. When they enter a negative number print the sum of all the numbers entered.

<h3>Arrays</h3>

        //1 Create an array of four numbers

        
        //2 Create an array of strings.


        //3 Console.log the 4th item in the array;
        let trees = ["pine", "spruce", "juniper", "larch", "yew"]

        
        //4 Using a for loop console.log every element in this array
        let sentenceArray = ["The","quick","brown","fox","jumps","over",'the',"lazy","dog"]


        
        //5 Loop through the array until you find the word language, when you find it console.log it's index in the array
        let words = ["A","sentence","is","the","basic","unit","of","language","which","expresses","a","complete","thought"]
